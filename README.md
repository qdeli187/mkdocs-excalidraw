## Usage
You can use this project's [docs](https://qdeli187.github.io/mkdocs-excalidraw/) as an example , lets break down how we do it.

1. Create an excalidraw drawing and save the file (I recommend using the vscode extension)
2. Add a reference to it in your markdown file as you would for an image
```markdown
![fig_name](drawings/test.excalidraw)
```
3. Thats it , the extension renders it as an svg in your browser
